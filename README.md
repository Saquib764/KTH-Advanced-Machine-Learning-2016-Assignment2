# KTH-Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016

This is a compilation of my mathematical + coding solutions for assignment 2 in KTH's Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016 course.
It includes implementation of Graphical models, Variational Inference and Expectation Maximization.
All the codes are in python and mathematical derivation are written in Latex.
I used ipython for development and directly downloaded the notebooks in .py files for uploading here, so it is possible that 
you might need to rewrite a few lines to get it working properly
